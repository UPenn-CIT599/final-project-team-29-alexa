Summary of Snake Game:
Snake Game is a computer game that allows users to grow the length of its "snake player" by moving their snake around the
screen via keystrokes to eat the green-dotted apple. Once the snake reaches the green-dotted apple, the snake grows in length.
The goal of the game is to get the snake length as long as you can *without* running into: (1) the snake's own body, (2) the walls,
or (3) your opponent's body (if you're playing 2 player or vs. Computer).

Game Modes:
There are three game modes the player can select from:
1 – Single player: You can play alone and try to grow the length of the snake on your own. No opponents.

2 – Two players: You can have two players simultaneously in the same window trying to eat apples to grow in length.
    There will only be one apple at a time so the player and opponent need to try to get to the apple first.

3 – Compete with AI: This is a human player (you) versus the computer (AI). The computer is coded with logic to try to get
    to the apple first but your goal is to try and beat the computer to the apple and grow in your snake's length.
